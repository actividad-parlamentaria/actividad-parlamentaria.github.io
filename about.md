I'm a computer engineering student currently studying in La Plata, Argentina. Having had a passion for computers ever since I was a kid, I decided to create this blog to discuss and document my programming experiences and projects.

The blog was created using Jekyll, a static site generator. The specific theme in use is a slightly modified version of Pixyll. I recommend installing the Lato and Source Code Pro fonts for an optimal experience while navigating the site.
