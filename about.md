I'm a computer engineering student currently studying in La Plata, Argentina. Having had a passion for computers ever since I was a kid, I decided to create this blog to discuss and document my programming experiences and projects.

The blog was created using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), a static site generator, while the specific theme in use is a slightly modified version of [Pixyll](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll). I recommend installing the [Lato](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/) and [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro) fonts for an optimal experience while navigating the site.
